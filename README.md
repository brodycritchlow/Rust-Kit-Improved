## Rustkit Improved - A Python library [remake](https://github.com/ddjerqq/rustkit) for Rust lovers.

> Rustkit is a Python library for Rust lovers. It provides a set of tools to write
Rust-like code in Python. It's written by a ~~fellow rustacean~~ python enthusiast.
In my opinion, Python is a great language, but it lacks some features that Rust
has. Rustkit Improved is an attempt to bring some of those features missing in Rustkit to Python.


## Roadmap

#### The following features are implemented:

- [x] Result [src](https://github.com/ddjerqq/rustkit/blob/master/rustkit/result.py)
- [x] Option [src](https://github.com/ddjerqq/rustkit/blob/master/rustkit/option.py)
- [x] Vector
- [x] Iterators

As of now, all of the roadmap is completed. I am looking for ideas to implement.
